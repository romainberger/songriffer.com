        "message": "Behind this bullshit cryptic update title, this is a purely 99% technical software engineering related update. But this is a very important one and here's why: this new version will allow you to get new features and improvements wayyyy faster than before. You'll transparently get most of the future updates, with some occasionnal big updates where you'll need to download a new version. But otherwise I won't bother you by downloading anything, you'll get new stuff without doing anything. This also means you'll get new stuff more often. So go ahead, download that new version and I'll deliver good stuff to you."
